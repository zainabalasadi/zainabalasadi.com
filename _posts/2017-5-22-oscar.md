## Reflections
Looking back at the initial scribbles and sketches I made in my notebook during initial brainstorming sessions, I’m highly surprised at the amount of progress I was able to make.

Choosing my first internship to be at a startup was a decision that I strongly stand by and I encourage other students to do the same. I could never have imagined being pushed so hard, learning so much and having a tonne of fun, all in just 3 short months.

I personally learned so much throughout the course of the project, especially the importance of working upwards, piece by piece where small parts come together over time to create positive change. Whilst I still believe that there are opportunities for improvement with the overall redesign, I now, more than ever, understand that design takes time and to improve user satisfaction rates by tenfolds in just three months proves to me what could be possible with more time.

I can gladly say that I’ve walked away from my time at Oscar more challenged and ambitious than ever before but also happier than I could’ve imagined having been able to learn from this experience and evolve as a designer, creator and maker.
