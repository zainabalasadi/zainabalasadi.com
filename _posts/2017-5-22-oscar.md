## Cool as fuck
LightLock was a project created as part of a Product Design & Development class at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. The project timeline was over the course of the spring semester of my senior year as a student of Industrial Design at the Rhode Island School of Design. Product Design & Develop is a hands-on studio class which takes place at MIT Sloan as a collaborative effort between RISD’s Industrial Design Department, and MIT Sloan.
