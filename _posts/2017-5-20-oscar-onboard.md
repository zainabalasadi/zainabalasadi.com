## Defining the problem
The start of a user's relationship with the Oscar app is the perfect opportunity to tell a complete, consistent and compelling story. Nowhere else is it more important to get the tone right, the instructions clear and allow user to begin to develop trust in the product.

Reviewing our statistics just a couple of weeks prior to redesigning, we knew that onboarding was letting us down. We were experiencing big dropout rates in onboarding (around 20% at every screen involved in the onboarding process) and returning users often had difficulty accessing their account, reaching out to customer support or even resorting to resetting their password.

> Small percentages of people completed the signup process. Some of those that did complete the process would leave and never come back.

The bad UX was hurting revenue and product reputation.

## Goals
Besides the *obvious* goal of increasing the number of users onboarded, we wanted the Oscar onboarding flow to:

- Introduce the app, explain important features and convince users of the benefits of using said features
- Increase user retention and long-term customer loyalty by getting them ready to book/list a parking spot
- Introduce our brand’s voice and tone on the first interaction with the app

As a sole product designer on this effort, I joined a team of 2 developers and a project manager to derive a refreshed onboarding experience in just under 1 month.

## Who are Oscar users?

## Research

## To the drawing board

## Testing

## Final solution

## Outcome
The redesign of the Oscar onboarding and login flow on iOS and Android has had a positive impact on both driver and spot owner experience. 

> At the time of writing this (3 months since launch), we've increased user activation by approximately 500% and decreased dropout rates by over 30%.

**Update:** 4 months after launch, the Oscar redesign won the Best Mobile App award from the Australasian Startup Awards for being recognised as the most user-friendly app that has disrupted its industry in Australasia 2018.
