## Reflection
Tackling my first ever VUI project brought me back to what I think is the original goal of UX, treating people like what they ultimately are: people.

It was interesting to see how I would cope designing something that didn’t have any interface. As a product designer that always worked with pixels, words began to matter more than ever and even found myself drawing user flow diagrams with sentences instead of screens (that was a strange sight!). I noticed that one word or even a single exclamation point altered the voice assistants personality and in turn, the user’s response and experience.

Face first into Alexa’s Skill Kit documentation, I’m currently developing the Mixer with Python.
