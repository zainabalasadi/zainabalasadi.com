I'm humbled that you made it here!

I'm Zainab (zay-nab). I gravitate towards projects that have a great impact, from helping kids with low-literacy find books they love to supporting a sustainable future through sharing.

When my nose isn’t pressed up against the screen, you can find me baking, reading and exploring the coasts of ever-sunny Sydney.
