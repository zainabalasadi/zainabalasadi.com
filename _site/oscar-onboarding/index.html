      <h2>Defining the problem</h2>
<p>The start of a user’s relationship with the Oscar app is the perfect opportunity to tell a complete, consistent and compelling story. Nowhere else is it more important to get the tone right, the instructions clear and allow user to begin to develop trust in the product.</p>

<p>Reviewing our statistics just a couple of weeks prior to redesigning, we knew that onboarding was letting us down. We were experiencing big dropout rates in onboarding (around 20% at every screen involved in the onboarding process) and returning users often had difficulty accessing their account, reaching out to customer support or even resorting to resetting their password.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Small percentages of people completed the signup process. Some of those that did complete the process would leave and never come back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bad UX was hurting revenue and product reputation.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Besides the <em>obvious</em> goal of increasing the number of users onboarded, we wanted the Oscar onboarding flow to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce the app, explain important features and convince users of the benefits of using said features</li>
  <li>Increase user retention and long-term customer loyalty by getting them ready to book/list a parking spot</li>
  <li>Introduce our brand’s voice and tone on the first interaction with the app</li>
</ul>

<p>As a sole product designer on this effort, I joined a team of 2 developers and a project manager to derive a refreshed onboarding experience in just under 1 month.</p>

<h2>Who are Oscar users?</h2>

<h2>Research</h2>

<h2>To the drawing board</h2>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h2>Final solution</h2>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The redesign of the Oscar onboarding and login flow on iOS and Android has had a positive impact on both driver and spot owner experience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the time of writing this (3 months since launch), we’ve increased user activation by approximately 500% and decreased dropout rates by over 30%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 4 months after launch, the Oscar redesign won the Best Mobile App award from the Australasian Startup Awards for being recognised as the most user-friendly app that has disrupted its industry in Australasia 2018.</p>
