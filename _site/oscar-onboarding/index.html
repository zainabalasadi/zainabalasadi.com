      <p>In 2018, I interned at Oscar where I was responsible for undertaking a complete overhaul of the product and create a painless sharing experience.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Oscar’s premise is simple—tap a couple buttons to book a parking spot or tap a couple buttons to list your parking spot and start earning. However, as the product and user base began to grow, more features were piled on that generated a myriad of friction points that effectively impeded users from completing their goals.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Quite simply, our goal was to restore the original premise of Oscar but to also create strong foundation that evolves with user needs.</p>

<p>The high level goals were to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make it fast for everyone to use</li>
  <li>Create a pain-free and positive experience</li>
  <li>Derive a scalable and unified design system</li>
</ol>

<p>As a sole UX designer on this effort, I joined a team of 2 developers and a project manager to create a vision for sharing experiences of the future all in under 3 short months.</p>

<h2>Picking up the Pieces</h2>
<p>Besides heuristic analysis and initial chats with the team, I had little insight into where—within the product—usability issues were arising from. I began speaking to stakeholders at Oscar to learn about the business and the product goals. These interviews helped in learning about previous research, determining the scope for the project and to better understand the opportunity for the redesign.</p>

<h2>Learning from the Users</h2>
<p>With these early insights, I went ahead and conducted a mixture of remote user interviews, surveys, usability testing and cafe studies with a spectrum of expert and new Oscar users. The goals for this initial round of user research were to:</p>

<p>With these early insights, I went ahead and conducted a mixture of remote user interviews, surveys, usability testing and cafe studies with a spectrum of expert and new Oscar users. The goals for this initial round of user research were to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand a users’ day-to-day workflows and pain points</li>
  <li>Learn more about how users interact with the product and the common habits that they have</li>
  <li>Learn more about what users viewed as the ideal sharing experience</li>
</ul>

<p>To further cement the impact that each feature had on the user when conducting usability testing, I kept the following key questions in mind.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What people-problem is this feature trying to solve?</li>
  <li>What is happening before people get in and start interacting with this screen?</li>
  <li>What are they feeling and thinking?</li>
  <li>What got them to this screen in the first place?</li>
  <li>What happens afterwards?</li>
  <li>After the interaction with this feature, how do I want users to feel?</li>
  <li>What do I want users to take away from the experience?</li>
</ol>
