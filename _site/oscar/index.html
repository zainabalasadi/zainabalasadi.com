<h4>Hello I’m a H4</h4>

<p>In 2018, I interned at Oscar where I was responsible for undertaking a complete overhaul of the product and create a painless sharing experience. 00A8A6</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Oscar’s premise is simple—tap a couple buttons to book a parking spot or tap a couple buttons to list your parking spot and start earning. However, as the product and user base began to grow, more features were piled on that generated a myriad of friction points that effectively impeded users from completing their goals.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Quite simply, our goal was to restore the original premise of Oscar but to also create strong foundation that evolves with user needs.</p>

<p>The high level goals were to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make it fast for everyone to use</li>
  <li>Create a pain-free and positive experience</li>
  <li>Derive a scalable and unified design system</li>
</ol>

<p>As a sole UX designer on this effort, I joined a team of 2 developers and a project manager to create a vision for sharing experiences of the future all in under 3 short months.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Geoff Ryman: 253 (Harper Collins, origionally online only 1996, physically published in 1998)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="approach">Picking up the Pieces</h2>
<p>Besides heuristic analysis and initial chats with the team, I had little insight into where—within the product—usability issues were arising from. I began speaking to stakeholders at Oscar to learn about the business and the product goals. These interviews helped in learning about previous research, determining the scope for the project and to better understand the opportunity for the redesign.</p>

<h2>Learning from the Users</h2>
<p>With these early insights, I went ahead and conducted a mixture of remote user interviews, surveys, usability testing and cafe studies with a spectrum of expert and new Oscar users. The goals for this initial round of user research were to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand a users’ day-to-day workflows and pain points</li>
  <li>Learn more about how users interact with the product and the common habits that they have</li>
  <li>Learn more about what users viewed as the ideal sharing experience</li>
</ul>

<p>To further cement the impact that each feature had on the user when conducting usability testing, I kept the following key questions in mind.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What people-problem is this feature trying to solve?</li>
  <li>What is happening before people get in and start interacting with this screen?</li>
  <li>What are they feeling and thinking?</li>
  <li>What got them to this screen in the first place?</li>
  <li>What happens afterwards?</li>
  <li>After the interaction with this feature, how do I want users to feel?</li>
  <li>What do I want users to take away from the experience?</li>
</ol>

The start of a user's relationship with the Oscar app is the perfect opportunity to tell a complete, consistent and compelling story. Nowhere else is it more important to get the tone right, the instructions clear and allow user to begin to develop trust in the product.

Reviewing our statistics just a couple of weeks prior to redesigning, we knew that onboarding was letting us down. We were experiencing big dropout rates in onboarding (around 20% at every screen involved in the onboarding process) and returning users often had difficulty accessing their account, reaching out to customer support or even resorting to resetting their password.

> Small percentages of people completed the signup process. Some of those that did complete the process would leave and never come back.

The bad UX was hurting revenue and product reputation.

## Goals
Besides the *obvious* goal of increasing the number of users onboarded, we wanted the Oscar onboarding flow to:

- Introduce the app, explain important features and convince users of the benefits of using said features
- Increase user retention and long-term customer loyalty by getting them ready to book/list a parking spot
- Introduce our brand’s voice and tone on the first interaction with the app

As a sole product designer on this effort, I joined a team of 2 developers and a project manager to derive a refreshed onboarding experience in just under 1 month.

## Who are Oscar users?
Internally within the team, we call the 3 Oscar user types: spot owners, drivers and hybrids.

Unfortunately, these 3 user types don't give us much insight into the goals and behaviours of our users. The first thing I wanted to learn more about was:

> Who are the people that attempt to onboard with Oscar?

Apart from that, I wanted to understand:

1. Why did they download the app?
2. How did they find this app?
3. What is happening before they start interacting with the first screen?
4. What are they feeling and thinking?
5. And after onboarding the user, how do we want them to feel?

With these questions in mind, I went ahead and conducted a mixture of in-person and remote user interviews with a spectrum of new and existing Oscar users (approximately 10 users). The aim was to answer the questions that I had above and derive a set of recurrent user persona's that capture the goals, frustrations and motivations of users. 

Some questions that we asked during the interview process included:
- How did you find out about Oscar?
- Why do you use the Oscar app?
- What goal does Oscar help you in achieving, if any?
- Have you ever used any other apps to help in achieving this goal?
- What frustrations come in the way of completing this goal?
- How often do you use the Oscar app?
- When do you actively use the Oscar app?

### Setter and forgetter
**Goal**: To generate secondary forms of income with little-to-no effort

**Motivated by**: Highly motivated by estimations of how much money they can possibly make by listing their parking spot

**Frustrations:** Long listing process, having to monitor and constantly interact with apps in order to generate secondary income

**Behaviour:** They'll list their parking spot on Oscar and watch the dollars come in, rarely interacting with the app after the initial listing and only visiting the app thereafter for pressing matters such as someone messaging them about their listing.

### Average Joe
**Goal**: To find cheaper alternatives for parking

**Motivated by**: Highly motivated by seeing how much they can save by parking through Oscar

**Frustrations:** Lack of parking spaces available in their desired location. They're cautious and tend to stay away from apps that ask too much too soon. 

**Behaviour:** They like to explore the app and its features before committing to making an account. Once an Oscar user, they rarely contribute and engage with the Oscar community. This means they'll rarely leave a review on a spot the parked (unless their experience is an outlier).

> I want to see if Oscar has parking spaces that I actually want before I commit to signing up.

### Power user
dunno yet

Regardless of each persona's behaviour once they become an Oscar user, all personas' first interaction with Oscar is through an article or the App Store/Play Store.

## Research
After analysing the most common types of users, I proceeded to understand how new and existing users interact with the current onboarding flow and extract the friction points within this flow. A mixture of cafe studies and contextual inquiries were used with approximately 10 users. We had our participants walk through the onboarding process within the app, asking for their opinion on the experience along the way. We concluded the study by uncovering three main friction points.

### Monotonous sign up process
Participants perceived the sign up process to be lengthy and monotonous. Confusion existed around how certain pieces of information are necessary in creating a new profile.

> “Why do I need to put in my birthday?” — New user I tested the product with.

### Confusion between Sign Up and Log In
A majority of participants often bounced back between Sign Up and Log In buttons, attempting each method until they found the one that would end in success. Coupled with a set of unsupportive error messages that pointed out their mistakes rather than directives to help in solving the issue, most participants would resort to resetting their password in order to access their account, a lengthy process in its own right.

### Questioning if Oscar is worth it
The laborious and confusing onboarding process resulted in participants questioning if the benefits of the app would outweigh the time and effort it takes to complete the onboarding process. Since participants had little insight into what Oscar can bring to the table, 60% of participants expressed that they would leave and delete the app without successfully onboarding.

This debacle resulted in higher error rates, lower conversion rates, increased churn and an overall bumpy entry-point into the app. Users assumed that if it was this difficult to get into the meat of the product, booking/listing their parking spot would be even bigger headache.

## To the drawing board
### Ideation
Taking the users most common pain points and reframing them into opportunities, I came up with three HMW (How might we) statements alongside possible features that would be helpful for these problem statements.

**How might we help users gain access Oscar features frictionlessly?**
Phone verification, password-less access, remove email

**How might we assist users in understanding what the Oscar app can do?**
Value propositions, app store description and image previews, explore the app feature

**How might we help users to quickly login to their account so that they can continue sharing?**
Phone verification

### User flows
One of the core tenets of onboarding is to remove all unnecessary friction that stands between a new user and their ability to jump straight into using the app. While passwords are foundational and necessary for ensuring secure access to private information, they aren't necessary for a user to realise how Oscar is going to improve their life within the next 2 minutes. This is why we began experimenting with an alternate password-less onboarding flow that, instead of placing the responsibility on the user to recall if they have an account as well as their email and password associated with their account, offloads that responsibility to Oscar.

The flow utilises the user's mobile number as the main form of user identification and verification rather than email, mainly due to the fact that exiting Oscar users expressed confusion around remembering which email they created their account with.

The 'Explore the app' feature was kept in this redesign as a large portion of users expressed that they want a way to check what the app offers before committing to sign up.

We introduced a few screens dedicated to introducing Oscar. Users can open newly downloaded apps in a few seconds or days later. We wanted to make sure that when a new user opens Oscar, they're immediately reminded what the app actually does and how it's going to help them.

For each step that required user input, we provided a clear and brief microcopy on why this information is necessary as well as how this information will be used. We did this to communicate trust signals to the users from the start. I experimented with a conversational tone for the microcopy to create a friendly and trustful tone inline with our brand voice.

## Testing
We tested these paper prototypes with the same group of participants from our initial user interviews. 

Despite the value proposition being displayed within the onboarding flow, a surprising insight was that a large percentage of drivers were not requesting parking spots after downloading the app and creating an account. What were they doing instead, you ask? They were exploring on how to add in their payment details and change their profile.

Users were spending time to figure out the app before they even began looking at spots to book or preparing their parking spot information so that they can list that spot on Oscar. 

My next HMW was:
**How might we use the moment when user’s motivation is high to give them a better booking/listing experience?**

Since we have two possible user types, we decided to split first-time users into two group so that we can subtly guide each user on what to do next, whether it be booking a spot or listing a spot.

To counteract the initial and elusive empty screens, we added empty states to hint at what kind of content could possibly appear in that section. This further encourages users to add content and provides another area where we can subtly pop a CTA.

Also, with a significant amount of users adding their payment method straight after they sign up, not only gave us a positive result, but also gave us a reason to make payment a step within the onboarding flow. Previously users were able to add payment details after they sign up, however this led to a worse booking/listing experience. This is because users who attempted to book a parking spot, or just listed their parking spot would then be required to enter a payment method, an additional step that got them thinking "What other hidden step is this app going to throw at me next?".

### Results
We tested these changes with 7 new users. This addition increased activation rates, 5 out of 7 users began searching for spots and starting to list their own parking spots straight after onboarding. 

### App store and Google Play
Making the user trust Oscar even before they begin downloading the app is a major onboarding step that we didn't forget about.

We polished app previews so that users are able to understand the purpose and benefit of the Oscar app at a glance.

## Final solution

## Outcome
The redesign of the Oscar onboarding and login flow on iOS and Android has had a positive impact on both driver and spot owner experience. 

> At the time of writing this (3 months since launch), we've increased user activation by approximately 500%, decreased dropout rates by over 30% and increased mid-term retention.

**Update:** 4 months after launch, the Oscar redesign won the Best Mobile App award from the Australasian Startup Awards for being recognised as the most user-friendly app that has disrupted its industry in Australasia 2018.

## What's next?
Despite the positive results, we're still looking to iterate and improve onboarding with Oscar by:

- Continuing to test and iterate on what information we ask users for after the intention prompt
- Continuing to work with the PM to gather insights from data and market research to ensure users are getting through the flow with no problems
