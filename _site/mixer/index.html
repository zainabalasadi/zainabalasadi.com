  <h2>Question</h2>
  <p>How might we make new music discovery effortless?</p>
</div>

<div class=" ">
  <h2>The problem with music discovery</h2>
  <p>There exists many music streaming services that offer millions of songs for listening. Many of these services also provide a feature whereby they recommend music that they believe a listener might like. However, very few of these services make music discovery easy and exciting. These features are often buried within the product, waiting to be found by the listeners who are most eager to hunt for new tunes. Once they’re found, they’re often difficult to navigate and cognitively exhausting.</p>

  <blockquote class="f2-l f3 mb5 mt5">
    <p>Right now, music discovery largely comes down to your willingness to exert the effort necessary to find new good things — Louie Herr from Digital Trends.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Music recommendation solutions available on the market today haven’t solved the issue of easy and enjoyable music discovery. The solutions are inconvenient, inefficient and unrewarding.</p>
</div>

<div class=" ">
  <h2>Understanding the issue</h2>
  <p>Music discovery has always been an issue of mine. Should I invest the time to go down the rabbit-hole that is the Spotify recommended playlist or should I just shuffle an old playlist of mine? From someone who used to count down the days till Monday where my beloved Spotify recommendations for the week were released, I barely give the playlist a second thought, scrolling past it with a shudder. It wasn’t always like this. I wanted to learn more about why this was happening. Were others experiencing the same problem?</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>The initial research</h2>
  <p>Delving deeper into the pain points surrounding music discovery,  I undertook my own surveys and interviews and extracted data from existing surveys on music recommendation.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_research.jpg" alt="The playlist mixer research toolkit" /></p>

<div class=" ">
  <h3>The findings</h3>

  <h3>Overwhelming</h3>
  <p>The biggest problem with music discoverability wasn’t actually discoverability.</p>

  <p>The most prominent opinion that participants had were that music recommendation playlist are overwhelmingly long. A sheer 84% agreed that they were overwhelmed by the number of music choices they had, whether good or bad. The result of these recommended song playlists are essentially someone spouting off a thousand really good recommendations in a five-minute span, which is just as ineffective as if a friend who gives you a single bad recommendation.</p>

  <blockquote class="f2-l f3 mb5 mt5">
    <p>Scrolling through recommended song playlist feels like watching movie credits — an interviewee’s response.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Valuing the journey, not the destination</h3>
  <p>Only 11% of participants said they weren’t happy with the music that was recommended to them but 46% still seek out music themselves, 26% primarily find music through algorithm-based recommendations and 16% prefer suggestions to come from friends or social media influencers.</p>

  <p>Whilst recommended music playlists do a decent job of recommending music that a user might like, many aren’t ready to leave it at that. Rather, listeners want to actively take part in finding new music and enjoy the journey of finding their next favourite song as much as the final destination. The algorithmic-driven recommendations strips the added excitement and emotional investment which is inherently part of discovery.</p>

  <h3>What you listen to is what you get</h3>
  <p>Whilst its often assumed that listeners are content with listening to one or two particular genres of music, this isn’t always the case. Approximately 59% struggle to find music outside of their own ‘musical bubble’ due to the narrow-minded nature of recommended music playlists, basing recommendations on previous streamings although the sweet satisfaction of a new favourite song heavily outweighs the time it might take to flip through a range of artists you’ve never encountered before.</p>
</div>

<div class=" ">
  <h2>The goals</h2>
  <p>Through extensive primary and secondary research, from observation, interviews, surveys, and more, I was able to distill a core set of user needs for the product solution.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Take a chunk of the user effort required out find new music</li>
    <li>Be able to customise recommendations in real time</li>
    <li>Give users the sense of credit for every discovery they make</li>
    <li>Provide users with options to further research a song or artist</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Introducing Mixer</h2>
  <p>Humanised through Amazon’s Alexa, Playlist Mixer is an Amazon skill that understands a your musical preferences and works with you—and not for you—to choose songs and create playlists.</p>

  <p>Instead of simply feeding data into an algorithm that delivers music suggestions, Playlist Mixer involves the user in the music discovery process and creating a more meaningful interaction. This in-turn creates a sense of connection to the artists and the music, stemming directly from the experience of exploring and finding them.</p>

  <blockquote class="f2-l f3 mb5 mt5">
    <p>The discovery is special, because they made it happen.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Basing the recommended music off the users previous music streamings, Playlist Mixer has the ability to further customise recommendations based on mood, genre, tempo and artist.</p>

  <p>Playlist Mixer works like this:</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_work.jpg" alt="How playlist mixer works" /></p>

<div>
  <h2>The design process</h2>
  <p>Initially brainstorming was based around deciding what medium to pursue for the product solution. It was clear that listeners still craved that sense of being the driver of the discovery so it was essential that my solution didn’t muddle that.</p>

  <p>Listeners didn’t like the algorithm that simply spit recommendations to them. Early explorations such as shorter recommended playlists, single recommendations and even a Tinder-eqsue swipe system still left listeners feeling like a witness of the discovery rather than the archeologist themselves.</p>
</div>

<!-- ![](../assets/images/site/grey.jpg) -->

<div>
  <p>Rather than an algorithm hiding behind UI elements and popping up in timed increments, what if the algorithm hid behind a voice?</p>

  <p>And so, the dots connection and the Playlist Mixer concept was born but it was the question if VUI was an appropriate medium for this problem space.</p>
</div>

<div>
   <img class="cap" alt="Exhausting the idea with questions" src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_questions.jpg" />
   <p class="caption light">Only some of the questions I had.</p>

   <img class="cap" alt="Delving into how VUI music recommender could work" src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_board.jpg" />
   <p class="caption light">Delving into how VUI music recommender could work.</p>
</div>

<div class=" ">
  <p>Like any technology going mainstream, I was cautious to jump on the VUI bandwagon as I wasn’t quite sure if it would be the correct medium for the problem.</p>

  <p>Adapted from Yogesh Moorjani’s article on chatbot design, I asked myself 5 questions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What is the outcome I want for users of my product/service?</li>
    <li>What is the business outcome I want to drive?</li>
    <li>Why would VUI be the best medium for this outcome?</li>
    <li>Does this idea replace tasks that people love doing?</li>
    <li>Is the cost for using this product/service less than the perceived value?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Asking these questions helped determine if VUI characteristics would help with use cases that were otherwise difficult to solve with a traditional UI.</p>

  <p>Users disliked manual music discovery because of the time and effort needed to invest into it. Alexa and Amazon Music could do the music discovery for the user. Manual music discovery is timely. Alexa and Amazon Music can find songs a user like in milliseconds. Not to mention that it would be more accurate and much more enjoyable.</p>

  <p>All systems were go.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>Borrowing from agile software methodologies, I began the wireframing process by defining a set of user stories for the Mixer. User stories represented the major scenarios; the purpose of the voice assistant and the way the user can interact with the voice assistant in short succinct sentences.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_story.jpg" alt="User stories to define functions" /></p>

<div>
  <p>It was essential that Playlist Mixer didn’t just recommend music based on previous listening history, but rather, also on inputs such as mood, tempo, occasion and artist.</p>

  <p>Next, I began ideating the keywords that could invoke the interaction. This was particularly difficult as the inbuilt Alexa phrase “Alexa, make me a playlist” or “Alexa, play me some songs” were already being used to carry out other commands.</p>

  <p>I settled on referring to Playlist Mixer as a separate entity and set the invocation name as “Playlist Mixer”. Whenever Alexa would hear “Playlist Mixer”, it knew what to do, no matter how the user phrased the command.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_invocation.jpg" alt="Invocation ideation for playlist mixer" /></p>

<div>
  <p>This resulted in a clearer division between the inbuilt empty playlist command and Playlist Mixer. In turn, I hypothesised that this would reduce the amount of errors.</p>

  <p>With the invocation name set and a list of the possible utterances (defined as whatever users say), I began crafting a few sample dialogues for the user stories.</p>

  <p>Unlike traditional UI where users can scroll through a list of songs to select a song, I didn’t have the luxury of playing users a consecutive list of songs and asking them to make a choice. Alexa could only provide one song at a time in order to reduce the cognitive and load and friction that is naturally found in VUI.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_path_sketches.jpg" alt="Playlist mixer paths" /></p>

<div>
  <p>I then went on to writing repairs or errors for the conversation. Since there isn’t a clear signal of intent (like the signal of a button click in traditional UI), it was up to me to anticipate the users intent at each point in the conversation and shape an appropriate error response and recovery strategy.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/alexa_conversational_repairs.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<div class=" ">
  <p>I went with two-tiered confidence for the Playlist Mixer in order to deliver the appropriate conversational repair to the circumstance. These tiers were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>No speech was detected</li>
    <li>Speech was detected but not understood</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Testing the concept</h2>
  <p>After creating a basic wireframe of the conversation, I took to testing. Wizard of Oz (WoZ) testing was the best testing method for this scenario. Often used for VUI, it is where humans interact with a system that seems real, when in reality, it’s controlled by someone behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>I conducted WoZ testing with 8 participants in order to get a rough idea of the types of responses that worked and didn’t. I not only noted how users interacted with Playlist Mixer and the utterances they used, but I also noted their facial expressions and body language. <strong>Did they frown at a particular answer? Did they laugh at a response? Did they barge-in while Mixer was speaking?</strong></p>
</div>

<div>
   <img class="cap" src="../assets/images/mixer/mixer_testing.jpg" />
   <p class="caption light">The testing environment: command line Alexa emulator and Mr Pringle, the stand in for Alexa.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>Following the WoZ testing, I gave participants a satisfaction questionnaire to complete and a couple of interview questions. This was my opportunity to know about the performance of Mixer through the participants eyes and ensure that Playlist Mixer would we able to cope with the variety of things that people say and the words they use to communicate their intent.</p>

  <p>I grouped questions into similar categories and analysed the questionnaire and interview answers to derive scores for aspects such as warmth, competence and discomfort.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="../assets/images/mixer/mixer_testing_results.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<div class=" ">
  <p>Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that users found Playlist Mixer to be highly reliable and energetic. Furthermore, 95% users stated that they were comfortable conversing with Playlist Mixer and describe the overall interaction as fun.</p>

  <p>Apart from the positive feedback, I gathered utterances which Mixer wouldn’t understand. For example, when asked if the user likes the previewed song, some users would reply with “Add it”. While this was an acceptable response, Alexa wouldn’t recognise this and reply with a conversational repair.</p>
</div>

<div class=" mb6">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Tackling my first ever VUI project brought me back to what I think is the original goal of UX, treating people like what they ultimately are: people.</p>

  <p>It was interesting to see how I would cope designing something that didn’t have any interface. As a product designer that always worked with pixels, words began to matter more than ever and even found myself drawing user flow diagrams with sentences instead of screens (that was a strange sight!). I noticed that one word or even a single exclamation point altered the voice assistants personality and in turn, the user’s response and experience.</p>

  <p>Face-first into Alexa’s Skill Kit documentation, I’m currently developing the Mixer with Python and hope to release the open-source product in the coming months.</p>

In 2018, I interned at Oscar where I was responsible for undertaking a complete overhaul of the product and create a painless sharing experience.

</div>

<div markdown="1">
## The Problem
Oscar’s premise is simple—tap a couple buttons to book a parking spot or tap a couple buttons to list your parking spot and start earning. However, as the product and user base began to grow, more features were piled on that generated a myriad of friction points that effectively impeded users from completing their goals.
</div>

</div>

<div class="{{ site.site-case-margin }} {{ site.site-case-break }}" markdown="1">
## The Challenge
Quite simply, our goal was to restore the original premise of Oscar but to also create strong foundation that evolves with user needs. 

The high level goals were to:
1. Make it fast for everyone to use
2. Create a pain-free and positive experience
3. Derive a scalable and unified design system

As a sole UX designer on this effort, I joined a team of 2 developers and a project manager to create a vision for sharing experiences of the future all in under 3 short months.
</div>

<div class="{{ site.site-case-margin }} {{ site.site-case-break }}" markdown="1">
## Picking up the Pieces
Besides heuristic analysis and initial chats with the team, I had little insight into where—within the product—usability issues were arising from. I began speaking to stakeholders at Oscar to learn about the business and the product goals. These interviews helped in learning about previous research, determining the scope for the project and to better understand the opportunity for the redesign.
</div>

<div markdown="1">
## Learning from the Users
With these early insights, I went ahead and conducted a mixture of remote user interviews, surveys, usability testing and cafe studies with a spectrum of expert and new Oscar users. The goals for this initial round of user research were to:
- Understand a users’ day-to-day workflows and pain points
- Learn more about how users interact with the product and the common habits that they have
- Learn more about what users viewed as the ideal sharing experience

To further cement the impact that each feature had on the user when conducting usability testing, I kept the following key questions in mind.

1. What people-problem is this feature trying to solve?
2. What is happening before people get in and start interacting with this screen?
3. What are they feeling and thinking?
4. What got them to this screen in the first place?
5. What happens afterwards?
6. After the interaction with this feature, how do I want users to feel?
7. What do I want users to take away from the experience?

## Opportunities and insights 
### Helping users onboard with ease
The onboarding flow is the first point of contact and impression a user has with the product. The current first impression wasn’t working so well. My research uncovered that the existing product generated around 10% in drop-off rates at every screen in the onboarding process, with the most being attributed to the very first screen. 
</div>

<div markdown="0">
   <img class="cap" alt="The old onboarding flow" src="../assets/images/oscar/oscar_old_onboard.jpg">
   <p class="caption light">The Oscar onboarding flow, featuring lengthy forms and double confirmations.</p>
</div>

<div markdown="1">
The process included a monotonous sequence of input fields, some of which, provided little context of how their purpose would aid in creating a profile.

>“Why do I need to put in my birthday?” — New user I tested the product with.
{: {{site.site-case-quote}}}

What was most alarming, aside from the drop-off rates, was that users often bounced back between Sign Up and Log In buttons, attempting each method until they found the one that would end in success. Coupled with a set of unsupportive error messages that pointed out user mistakes rather than supportive directives to help the user solve the issue, most users would resort to resetting their password in order to access their account, a lengthy process in its own right. 
</div>

![The problematic onboarding user flow](../assets/images/oscar/oscar_onboard_usecase.jpg)

<div class="{{ site.site-case-margin }} {{ site.site-case-break }}" markdown="1">
This debacle resulted in higher error rates, lower conversion rates, increased churn and an overall bumpy entry-point into the app. Users assumed that if it was this difficult to get into the meat of the product, booking/listing their parking spot would be even bigger headache.
</div>

<div markdown="1">
### Searching for a Spot
Every time a user entered the app, they were greeted with the search screen. Comprising of a search form and map, the search screen is where the majority of our driver personas spend their time.

Users search for a parking spot through inputting three key pieces of information: their desired parking location, the start time of their booking and the end time of their booking. These three components were displayed as a combination of input bars and time selectors and allowed users to find a suitable parking spot for their needs. It was amazing when it worked.
</div>

<div markdown="0">
   <img class="cap" alt="The old search flow" src="../assets/images/oscar/oscar_old_search.jpg">
   <p class="caption light">The Oscar search and booking flow.</p>
</div>

<div markdown="1">
I first had a hunch of experience issues within the search screen during initial user testing, users spent an abnormally long time to take in this screen despite its visual simplicity. Probing further, I noticed that around 40% experienced issues with search at some point which resulted in costly mistakes such as:
- Booking spots for time periods that users weren’t even looking for. A common behaviour were users booking a spot for the default 1 hour and later extending their booking to the actual time period that they required
- Booking spots at locations they weren’t looking for

These combination of issues led to repeated rapid-clicks, a clear signal of user frustration. This resulted in some users to abandon interaction with the search bar altogether and utilise other methods like navigating through a map manually. 

Analysis of user behaviour over the long term uncovered that almost 80% of our users have at least one location where they repeatedly book. These repeat bookings would occur in the same suburb, street or even the exact same parking spot. We also noticed that our users followed the exact same flow to do this every time. Having to repeatedly follow the exact process was a huge friction point and left them feeling unsupported.
</div>

![The repeat user behaviour](../assets/images/oscar/oscar_repeat_behaviour.jpg)

<div markdown="1">
### Listing a Spot
The chief complaint about the listing experience was that it felt like a generic form and lacked and lacked excitement. This resulted in users leaving the listing flow prematurely. Through user interviews, I uncovered the three main reasons for this action:

- A user leaves to gather information they might not have on hand. For example, not all homeowners know what size car their parking spot will fit.
- A user leaves the listing flow to complete another task
- A user has difficulty answering questions and leaves to ask/contact Oscar assistance

Since the product didn’t include a way to still retain inputted information, users rarely returned to complete their listing and a whopping 80% of users never even visited the listing flow after their first attempt.

<div class="{{ site.site-case-margin }} {{ site.site-case-break }}" markdown="1">
## How we got there
To jumpstart creativity, I came up with four key design challenges that revolved around the four main issues within the current product:

1. How might we better give users quick access to their account?
2. How might we better adapt the search screen to minimise booking errors?
3. How can we support repeat user actions?
4. How might we support users to list with ease?
</div>

<div markdown="1">
## Giving users quick access to their account
Understanding why users were confused between Sign Up and Log In was a challenge on its own.

My first hypothesis was that there wasn't a clear division between Sign Up and Log in as the terminology for these buttons wasn't quite right. So I experimented with new UIs that did just that but to my surprise, this had no benefit… new and existing users still occasionally switched between the two.
</div>

![First instinct was to change the terminology](../assets/images/oscar/oscar_onboard_experiment.jpg)

<div markdown="1">
Questioning further, a majority of participants revealed that the major reason that they experienced problematic entry to the app was that they simply didn’t know that they had an account.

>“It’d be nice if I was told I have an account before I fill out the rest of the form” — a user I tested the product with.
{: {{site.site-case-quote}}}

Based on this insight, I realised that simply modifying the error messages to be clearer and more supportive wasn’t going to solve the issue or create a calm experience. So instead of placing the responsibility of the user to recall that they have an account, know their email and their password, I began experimenting with an an alternate flow that offloaded the responsibility to Oscar.
</div>

   <p class="caption-between light">Experimenting with removing divisions of Sign Up and Login.</p>
</div>

<div markdown="1">
The new proposed onboarding flow works by removing concrete decisions between Sign Up and Login and asks the user upfront for an easily recallable piece of information: a mobile number. After the mobile number is provided, the product would then intelligently determine if this information exists in its database and then discreetly deliver the remaining flow custom to the user’s circumstance. 

Central to this feature, were these key ideas:
1. Stop relying on user recall. Do the heavy lifting for them.
2. Establish the feeling of support as early as early as possible.
3. Ask as little questions as possible. Get users sharing as soon as you can.
</div>

![The new onboarding flow](../assets/images/oscar/oscar_new_onboard.jpg)

To get new users up and going as soon as possible and creating a lower barrier to entry, I experimented with delaying additional information that the user would need to input (such as vehicle registration and account verification) until deeper in the user journey, such as booking or listing a spot. Once a user has found a spot that they’d like to book or list, spending an extra minute to confirm details is as much of a friction point.

Fearing that the fundamentally new onboarding flow would cause friction of its own, I began testing early stages of the designs as soon as possible. To my surprise, not a single participant had trouble with the sequencing of the new flow and the design resonated well with participants.

## Minimising booking errors
A culprit of many headaches, the search screen resulted in many users incorrectly booking a parking spot. 

My first hypothesis on why this screen was causing so many issues was that the search bar appeared “optional”. With so much emphasis on the map, user attention was skewed towards it.

Early explorations of the new search screen played around with depth and scale.

The new search screen features a search bar floating on top of the map, creating a greater understanding of its function and importance. Whilst the map still takes up a majority of the screen real estate, it’s no longer the big star of the interface.

Introducing a default valid approach to the search bar and time selectors further reduces mental friction and speaks to the user, “you don’t need to do anything, but feel free to customise the search to better suit your needs”.

To further accelerate bookings and cater for the 80% of users that make repeat bookings, I designed an accelerators feature that gives users quick access to their most likely destinations. 

Accelerators work by intelligently remembering how often a user visits a location and prompt the user to add the location to a list of saved places, asking simply for the name of the saved place.

## Listing
I hypothesised that breaking the listing flow into digestible chunks would result in increased excitement and further understanding of each section. 

Contextually chunking sections of the listing flow (like address, type, maximum fit) and embellishment sections (like description and photos) better aligned to the users mental model and decreased the amount of “huh?” and “what does this mean?!”

In an effort to increase completion rates, I incorporated a progress bar helps users speed through the flow. By allowing our users to see how much longer they have left in the listing process, we can motivate those who contemplate dropping off early in the funnel.

To combat the issue of incomplete spot listings, I introduced a draft spot listing feature whereby users can save and exit at any stage of the spot listing process. Not only does this save time of re-inputting information when the user chooses to list their spot but this feature opened the gates to prompts, utilising the completion rate data and introducing pop-ups triggered after incremental periods of time to assist the user to finish their listing and start earning.

## The Results
The redesign of the Oscar app on iOS and Android has had a positive impact on both the driver and spot owner experience, at the time of writing this (3 months since launch). 

- User activation increased by 500%
- Booking error rates decreased by 30%
- Booking time decreased by 20%

**For confidentiality reasons I have omitted the actual values for these metrics*.

## What I learned
Looking back at the initial scribbles and sketches I made in my notebook during initial brainstorming sessions, I’m highly surprised at the amount of progress I was able to make.

Choosing my first internship to be at a startup was a decision that I strongly stand by. I could never have imagined being pushed so hard, learning so much (cool things outside my bubble of design and tech!) and having a tonne of fun, all in just 3 short months. 

I personally learned so much throughout the course of the project, especially the importance of being curious and continually reaching out to different types of people for feedback and criticism. Each person plays an essential role and has a plethora of knowledge to offer.

I can gladly say that I’ve walked away from my time at Oscar more challenged and ambitious than ever before but also happier than I could’ve imagined having been able to learn from this experience and evolve as a designer, creator and maker.

Key takeaways
{: .bold}
- Get over the feeling of making mistakes and being wrong. Learning from mistakes is the fastest and most effective way to grow as a designer.
- It’s important to give users choice but its also important to understand when choice is a barrier. 
- Make informed design decisions. Designers intuition is good starting point but it shouldn’t be the only reason for a design choice.
