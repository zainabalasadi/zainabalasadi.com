### About me:

I’m a designer and engineer living in Sydney, Australia. I rethink the status quo through experimentation, compassion and inclusivity.

### Work:

Currently, I’m a CS thesis student at [UNSW](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/computer-science-engineering/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, exploring how scientists can automate lab tasks through human-robot interaction.

I’m also a researcher at [Wriveted](https://www.wriveted.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, helping students find books they love through a conversational interface. Before that, I was at [Macquarie Bank](https://www.macquarie.com.au/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Oscar](https://www.sharewithoscar.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [180DC](https://180dc.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Recent musings:

“An exclusion habit is the belief that whoever starts the game also sets the rules of the game. We think we don’t have power to change a game, so we abdicate our accountability."
